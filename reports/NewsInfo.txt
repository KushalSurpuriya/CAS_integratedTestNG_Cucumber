***************Gender equity and women in technology***************The International Day for Women and Girls in Science is celebrated every year on February 11 to recognize the critical role that women and girls play in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The day was established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 to promote full and equal access to and participation in science for women and girls, and to achieve gender equity and the empowerment of women and girls.
 According to UNESCO, only 35% of all students in STEM-related fields of study are women, and only 33.3% of researchers worldwide are women. Moreover, women face barriers such as gender stereotypes, lack of role models, mentoring and networking opportunities, and discrimination and bias in the workplace. And so that we can see developments not only in the number of women in the field, but to achieve better results in innovation that this diversity offers, we always need to remember what our part is in the change.
 To address these challenges and increase the number of women in technology, several initiatives have been launched by governments, institutions, civil society organizations and private sector. At Cognizant in addition to promoting inclusion, we are committed to clear goals of increasing representation of women in leadership roles, which are driven by programs like Propel, our exclusive female leadership development program for mid- and senior-level women leaders across the world that has benefited more than 1700 associates up till end 2023, and the Cognizant® Returnship Program, a 3-month paid experience for talented technology professionals transitioning back into the workforce.
 Women in technology are essential for the advancement and sustainability of the field and you can help:
 Recognize: It is not new that we have women developing groundbreaking algorithms, software, hardware, and systems that have shaped the history and future of computing, such as Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper, Katherine Johnson, Radia Perlman, Shafi Goldwasser, and many others. So, remember to recognize women for their achievements, most of them may not have yet realized how great they are. They deserve recognition, respect, and support for their work and potential.
 Support: Whether it’s presenting programs and training to co-workers, promoting women, or Outreach to teach technology to girls, there are many ways you can not only show your support, but take action. Extra tip: get to know some important institutions such as Girl Start, Girls Inc., Code First Girls, National Center for Women and Information Technology, Ada Developers Academy, or contact the Outreach team and find out how to contribute.
 Improve your knowledge: Take one of the D&I trainings, such as Allyship in Action.
 Be an Ally: Join Women Empowered, Cognizant women’s Affinity Group that elevates the experience of work for women and creates impact for the business. 
 By empowering women and girls in technology, we can unleash their potential to create innovative solutions for the global challenges we face today. As the UN Secretary-General António Guterres said: "We can all do our part to unleash our world’s enormous untapped talent – starting with filling classrooms, laboratories, and boardrooms with women scientists."
***************Cognizant shines at the Times Group Global Business Summit (GBS)***************The ET Now Global Business Summit 2024 brought together some of the world’s leading CEOs, heads of state and policymakers to deliberate on and discuss critical issues of our time and map the future. The theme of the summit was Disruption, Development and Diversification.
 Addressing the summit in his keynote, our CEO, Ravi Kumar spoke on Generative AI's power to shape the future of work and later in the day spoke at a panel discussion on the topic Fissures, Faultlines and Future.
 Highlights from Ravi's keynote:
  “Cognizant is at the forefront of leveraging technological advancements. Generative AI represents a departure from past technological shifts, fundamentally altering the landscape of jobs, skills, tasks, and occupations while fostering upward social mobility. Unlike its predecessors, Generative AI follows a steeper S-curve trajectory, significantly transforming various industries,” he said. 

Comparing the Generative AI’s impact to historical computing changes, Ravi added, “Businesses must adapt by reorganizing operations, prioritizing safety, trust, and equity to ensure a fair and inclusive future. Its rapid diffusion and bidirectional understanding between humans and machines mirror past technological revolutions.”
 He concluded by highlighting Cognizant’s focus on technological continuity, emphasizing the imperative for businesses to adapt their strategies alongside advancing technologies to cultivate a prosperous and inclusive future workforce.
  Ravi also participated in a panel discussion on the topic Fissures, Faultlines and Future – In Search of an Equilibrium, along with other eminent industry leaders including Bill Winters, CEO, Standard Chartered, Jenny Johnson, President and CEO, Franklin Templeton, Rizwan Sajan, Founder and Chairman, Danube Group and Suneeta Reddy, MD, Apollo Hospitals. The leaders discussed some of the most critical problems faced by the world today, the role of AI, and the growth roadmap for India.
